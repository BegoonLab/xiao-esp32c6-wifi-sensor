## Features

- **WiFi Connectivity**: Seamless connection to your home or office network.
- **MQTT Integration**: Publishes sensor data to an MQTT broker in JSON format.
- **Environmental Sensing**: Supports [Bosch BME280](https://www.bosch-sensortec.com/products/environmental-sensors/humidity-sensors-bme280/) and [BME680](https://www.bosch-sensortec.com/products/environmental-sensors/gas-sensors/bme680/) sensors for temperature, humidity, and pressure measurements.
- **Power Management**: Efficiently manages power using LiPo batteries with built-in charge management.
- **Deep Sleep Mode**: Extends battery life by enabling deep sleep between data transmissions.
- **Optional Features**:
    - Battery voltage monitoring
    - Connection duration tracking
    - Future support for WiFi 6 and Bluetooth provisioning (TODO)

## Usage

The Smart IoT Sensor can be easily integrated with [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) for real-time monitoring and automation.

### MQTT Data Structure

The sensor publishes data to an MQTT broker in the following JSON format:
```json
{
  "ID": "7i29r9k9ltaxmbev",
  "RSSI": -54,
  "battery_voltage": 4.13,
  "temperature": "24.28",
  "humidity": "29.32",
  "pressure": "999.54",
  "connection_duration_ms": 1672
}
```
- **ID**: Unique identifier of the sensor
- **RSSI**: WiFi signal strength in dBm
- **battery_voltage**: Current battery voltage
- **temperature**: Temperature reading from the BME sensor
- **humidity**: Humidity reading from the BME sensor
- **pressure**: Pressure reading from the BME sensor
- **connection_duration_ms**: Time taken to establish the MQTT connection

# Schematics

**Note:** This solution continuously consumes some current from the battery but is functional for voltage monitoring.

## Configuration

This build developed and tested with [ESP-IDF v5.3.1](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/releases/tag/v5.3.1)
Follow [this instruction](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/v5.3.1/esp32/get-started/index.html#manual-installation) to install it. It is required.

Configure the sensor using the following steps:

```
idf.py menuconfig
```

Then go to `XIAO Sensor Configuration`

1. **Wi-Fi Configuration**: Set up your Wi-Fi credentials to enable network connectivity.
2. **MQTT Configuration**: Connect the sensor to your MQTT server by providing the necessary broker details.
3. **Battery Check (Optional)**: Enable battery voltage monitoring if power management insights are needed.
4. **BME Sensor Configuration (Optional)**: Choose between BME280 and BME680 sensors based on your requirements.
4. **Power Management Configuration**: Setup wakeup. The duration in seconds that the device will remain in deep sleep before waking up

## Enclosure

The sensor is housed in a customizable 3D-printed enclosure. STL files are available for download and 3D printing.

*Placeholder for STL files download link or additional instructions.*
